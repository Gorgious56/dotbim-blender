# dotbim-blender

## Description

It is a bridge between .bim files and Blender. Check out dotbim.net or main repo for dotbim (https://github.com/paireks/dotbim) to read more about .bim files :)

Script was created for Blender 2.91.

## How to run a script

1. First you need to install dotbimpy (https://github.com/paireks/dotbimpy) for Blender's Python. Check where it's packages are located (e.g. for me it was C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender 2.91\2.91\python\lib). Once you've found it, you need to install dotbimpy there. It can be done e.g. by:
```cmd
pip install --target="your\path" dotbimpy
```

2. Copy-paste the script into Scripting's editor inside Blender, change path if it's needed, and press run
